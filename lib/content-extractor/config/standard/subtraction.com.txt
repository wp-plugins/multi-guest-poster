# A simpler alternative would be to use body-lead as the body.
# However, this removes the author and date, which we want to keep. 

body: //div[@class='day']

# take out the bit saying 'body'
strip: //div[@class='body-lead']/div[@class='info-label']

# remove duplicate of the title
strip: //div[@class='day']/h2[1]

# remove the time posted
strip: //div[@class='day']/div[@class='post-info'][1]

# remove categories (tags)
strip: //div[@class='day']/div[@class='post-info'][3]

# take out that plus sign at the bottom of the post
strip: //div[@id='terminator']

# prune, otherwise the author is removed
prune: no
