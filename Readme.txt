Upload `multi-guest-poster` directory from ZIP-archive (if you install from standalone ZIP file) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (in the end it should look like /wp-content/plugins/multi-guest-poster/multi-guest-poster.php etc.) Upload all the files using "Binary" FTP transfer mode, is important.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
